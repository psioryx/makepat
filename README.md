# THIS DOC IS CURRENTLY INCOMPLETE / EARLY ALPHA

A collection of autolisp scripts for creating real autocad .pat hatch patterns.

## History:
In 1998 I was contracted to create a ton of hatch patterns. At the time I was creating them manually with text editor and my HP calculator. I took a contract for some designs that were way to complex to do manually. I spent 2 weeks creating a set of scripts that in most cases does all the work and in the more complex cases makes the process MUCH less time consuming. I've never found any tool that can do what this does so finally getting around to sharing it.

## Scripts
* makepat.lsp
* fixangles.lsp
* scalepat.lsp
